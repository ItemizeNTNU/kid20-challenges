## Description

Well, as the description of the task suggest, we want to find the price of the butter that Kristian is holding. We do not have any price tag on the butter, which means that scanning the barcode is our only hope. You could use your smartphone as scanner if your camera has a high resolution. Alternatively, you could use your favourite image editor, crop out the barcode, and submit it e.g. [here](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx).
