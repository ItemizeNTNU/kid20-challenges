# clue-hunter
## Description
In this challenge you are presented with an image and asked to look for clues using either a magnifying glass or an image analysis tool. If you visually inspect the image (no magnifying glass actually needed) you can find the flag on the black background to the right of Kristian's head.
Alternatively you can open the image in an image analysis tool and invert the colours. The flag should then imediately become obviously visible.
