Using the attached python code, I encoded our flag into 72 different files with one hexadecimal character stored in each file.

Are you able to merge them into one flag?
---------------------
In this challange, there were a flag consisting of 72 files. Each file represented 1 hexadecimal, witch had to be put together in order to decode the flag. 

By reading all files, and merging together each hexadecimal, you were able to fetch the flag.
